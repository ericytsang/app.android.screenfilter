# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why does the accessibility service keep turning off by itself?
This happens because of overly aggressigve *"battery optimization"*. Trackpad has no control over this. On most devices, you can disable app optimization for Trackpad in Android's Settings to stop it from disabling the accessibility service. This is usually found in `Settings > Battery`, and sometimes in `Apps & Notifications > Special app access > Battery optimization`.

## Why doesn't the app do anyting after I turned on the Accessability Service?
[That is a bug](https://github.com/ericytsang/app.android.touchpad/issues/1) :( usually, restarting your phone will fix this.

## Couldn't find an answer?
Ask the dev team, and other Trackpad users on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rkdaYNx)!
